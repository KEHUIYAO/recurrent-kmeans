Starting parallel pool (parpool) using the 'local' profile ...
{Error using parpool (line 104)
You requested a minimum of 24 workers, but the cluster "local" has the
NumWorkers property set to allow a maximum of 18 workers. To run a
communicating job on more workers than this (up to a maximum of 512 for the
Local cluster), increase the value of the NumWorkers property for the cluster.
The default value of NumWorkers for a Local cluster is the number of cores on
the local machine.
